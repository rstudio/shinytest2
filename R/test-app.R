#' Test Shiny applications with \pkg{testthat}
#'
#' This is a helper method that wraps around [`testthat::test_dir()`] to test your Shiny application or Shiny runtime document.  This is similar to how [`testthat::test_check()`] tests your R package but for your app.
#'
#' When setting up tests for your app,
#'
#' @details
#'
#' Example usage:
#'
#' ```{r, eval = FALSE}
#' ## Interactive usage
#' # Test Shiny app in current working directory
#' shinytest2::test_app()
#'
#' # Test Shiny app in another directory
#' path_to_app <- "path/to/app"
#' shinytest2::test_app(path_to_app)
#'
#' ## File: ./tests/testthat.R
#' # Will find Shiny app in "../"
#' shinytest2::test_app()
#'
#' ## File: ./tests/testthat/test-shinytest2.R
#' # Test a shiny application within your own {testthat} code
#' test_that("Testing a Shiny app in a package", {
#'   shinytest2::test_app(path_to_app)
#' })
#' ```
#'
#' @section Uploading files:
#'
#' When testing an application, all non-temp files that are uploaded should be
#' located in the `./tests/testthat` directory. This allows for tests to be more
#' portable and self contained.
#'
#' When recording a test with [`record_test()`], for every uploaded file that is
#' located outside of `./tests/testthat`, a warning will be thrown. Once the
#' file path has be fixed, you may remove the warning statement.
#'
#' @section Different ways to test:
#'
#' `test_app()` is an opinionated testing function that will only execute
#' \pkg{testthat} tests in the `./tests/testthat` folder. If (for some rare
#' reason) you have other non-\pkg{testthat} tests to execute, you can call
#' [`shiny::runTests()`]. This method will generically run all test runners and
#' their associated tests.
#'
#' ```r
#' # Execute a single Shiny app's {testthat} file such as `./tests/testthat/test-shinytest2.R`
#' test_app(filter = "shinytest2")
#'
#' # Execute all {testthat} tests
#' test_app()
#'
#' # Execute all tests for all test runners
#' shiny::runTests()
#' ```
#'
#' @param app_dir The base directory for the Shiny application.
#'   * If `app_dir` is missing and `test_app()` is called within the
#'     `./tests/testthat.R` file, the parent directory (`"../"`) is used.
#'   * Otherwise, the default path of `"."` is used.
#' @param env Use the Shiny application's environment after sourcing the R folder
#' @param ... Parameters passed to [`testthat::test_dir()`]
#' @seealso [`record_test()`], [`testthat::test_dir()`]
#' @export
