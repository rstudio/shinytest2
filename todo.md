talk to lionel about snapshots

issue in testthat for keeping snapshots if they are not touched
  https://github.com/r-lib/testthat/issues/1143

automate platform / R version suffix

  auto commit results
  upload an artifact with updated snapshots
    like fix_all_branches, it must be initiated manually, but _automated_


https://github.com/r-lib/vdiffr/blob/fc03e91cccac04baa875063513b630d80c02e197/R/expect-doppelganger.R#L99-L102
  # Announce snapshot file before touching `fig` in case evaluation
  # causes an error. This allows testthat to restore the files
  # (see r-lib/testthat#1393).
  testthat::announce_snapshot_file(name = file)


handle failures:
https://github.com/r-lib/vdiffr/blob/fc03e91cccac04baa875063513b630d80c02e197/R/expect-doppelganger.R#L127-L151
push_log stores information to a log file that is visible by cran and the testthat fail output logs

provide custom function to compare the files:
https://github.com/r-lib/vdiffr/blob/fc03e91cccac04baa875063513b630d80c02e197/R/expect-doppelganger.R#L132


use the annouce_snapshot_file w/ the `suffix` so that they other files are not deleted. Do not announce the main file?

Make two classes of shinytest objects:
* One for shinytest2 legacy that throws deprecation messages and errors.
  * ShinyDriver2Legacy$new()?
* Another that is the ideal shinytest2 object. This should not contain deprecated methods
  * ShinyDriver2$new() ?
  * Shintest2$new() ?

Alpha order input values when serializing to json

conversion notes
  shinytest -> shinytest2
  phantomTimeout -> X


  `$findElement()` does not support `linkText`, `partialLinkText`, `xpath`

  <!-- $executeScript -> $executeScript -->
  $executeScriptAsync -> $executeScriptCallback

  `Widget$new(element=)` -> `Widget2$new(nodeId=)`

  app$snapshot(*) -> expect_shinytest2_snapshot(app, *)

  make a second class for ShinyDriver2Legacy
    ShinyDriver2$initalize() Added `...`
    ShinyDriver2Legacy$snapshotInit(path=) does not makes sense
    ShinyDriver2Legacy$snapshotInit(screenshot=) was moved to ShinyDriver2$initialize(screenshot=)


ShinyDriver2$waitFor returns `FALSE` if a condition is not found in time. (Not `NA`)
execut




#' @seealso [testthat::snapshot_review()] and [testthat::snapshot_accept()] if
#'   you want to compare or update snapshots after testing. In most cases, the
#'   user is prompted to do these tasks interactively, but there are also times
#'   where it is useful to call these functions from the console.
