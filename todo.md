Future release:
  * GHA integration
    * upload an artifact with updated snapshots
      * like fix_all_branches, it must be initiated manually, but _automated_
### Vignettes:
* Getting started
  * Medium difficulty example:
    * Use an `$expect_screenshot()` with a `variant`
    * explain what a variant is
  * How to review different variants
