# test-app

[![RStudio
community](https://img.shields.io/badge/community-github--actions-blue?style=social&logo=rstudio&logoColor=75AADB)](https://community.rstudio.com/new-topic?category=Package%20development&tags=github-actions)

This action tests a Shiny application (or Shiny-based document) using
the [`{shinytest2}`](https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest2) package. The
`${{ inputs.app-dir}}/tests/testthat/_snaps` directory will be uploaded
if enabled (default).

# Usage

Inputs available: - app-dir - default `"."`. Directory of Shiny
application (or Shiny-based document) to test

Typical GHA step usage:

``` yaml
- uses: rstudio/shinytest2/actions/test-app@v1
  with:
    app-dir: "."
```

# Example workflows

These workflows are a good building block / starting point for testing
your Shiny applications. You may need to alter what is actually executed
to fit your needs.

  - [`test-app-description`](#dependencies-in-description-file) - An
    example CI workflow to test your Shiny application given you are
    using a `DESCRIPTION` file to state your dependencies.
  - [`test-app-renv`](#dependencies-managed-by-renv) - An example CI
    workflow to test your Shiny application given you are using `{renv}`
    to manage your dependencies.
  - [`test-app-package`](#app-within-package-structure) - An example CI
    workflow to test a Shiny application within your local R package. It
    is recommended to use `app-dir` input to set the location of your
    Shiny application.

## Dependencies in DESCRIPTION file

Install workflow using:

``` r
usethis::use_github_action(
  url = "https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest2/raw/main/actions/test-app/example-test-app-descrption.yaml",
  save_as = "test-app-description.yaml"
)
```

## Dependencies managed by `{renv}`

Install workflow using:

## App within Package structure

If you are using a local package and want to test an application within
the same repo, this may be a good option. However, it is recommended to
try to execute these tests as a part of your standard `{testthat}`
testting.

Install workflow using:

``` r
usethis::use_github_action(
  url = "https://github.com/rstudio/shinytest2/raw/main/actions/test-app/example-test-app-package.yaml",
  save_as = "test-app-package.yaml"
)
```

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

name: Test package app

jobs:
  test-package-app:
