# shinytest2 (development version)

## New Features

* `compare_screenshot_threshold()` is a new method to compare screenshots and allow small differences between two screenshots. This method checks every subset matrix of the pixel differences between the two images. If any total difference is larger than the `threshold` value, the two images are considered to be different. The subset matrix size can be increased by setting `kernel_size`. (#231)

* Support for supply your own compare method to `AppDriver$expect_screenshot(compare=)` has been added. By default, `AppDriver$expect_screenshot(compare=)` is set to `compare_screenshot_threshold(threshold = NULL)` which in turn calls `testthat::compare_file_binary()`. So no default screenshot expectation behavior has changed. (#231)

* `test_app()` now inherits the existing test reporter when testing multiple apps within a package test file. This allows for a seamless, single reporter output instead of nested reporters being displayed. (#192)

* The recording browser window is now closed when either the "Save test and exit" or "Exit" buttons are clicked. (@daattali, #202)

* When testing and `{chromote}` can not be started, the test will be skipped. When testing on windows in CI, `{chromote}` will get an extra attempt to be started (#225)

* Make `{globals}` an `Imports` package, instead of a `Suggests` package (#223)

* Add support for _not_ recording the screen size when recording a test (#223)


## Bug / Improvements

* Fix set of bugs found by @daattali including test files should be opened in the IDE after recording and test and replace missing images in the website (#199)

* Provide example workflows on how to use `rstudio/shinytest2/actions/test-app` GHA action (#217)

* When setting a date time slider value, it can now handle array inputs properly. When recording a date time slider value, numeric values will not be recorded as milliseconds instead of seconds since epoch. (#223)

* When creating a test setup file for `{shinytest2}`, use the file path `tests/testthat/setup-shinytest2.R` instead of `tests/testthat/setup.R` to provide some quick context within the file name (#224)

* Remove trailing comma causing render bug in recorder app (@mehrnoushmalek, #239)

* Update {lintr} lints to v3 (#240)

* Fixed GHA links for `rstudio/shinytest2/actions/test-app@v1` (#249)

* Fix documentation on on `AppDriver`'s `delay` parameter being in **seconds**, not *milli*seconds (#255)

* Added support for `AppDriver$stop(timeout=)`. The default timeout when sending `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and `SIGKILL` signals to the `{shiny}` process is now 500ms. However, if `{covr}` is running, the default timeout is 20,000 ms to allow time for the report to generate. (#259)
