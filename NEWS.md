* `test_app()` now inherits the existing test reporter when testing multiple apps within a package test file. This allows for a seamless, single reporter output instead of nested reporters being displayed. (#192)

* Fix set of bugs found by @daattali including test files should be opened in the IDE after recording and test and replace missing images in the website (#199)

* The recording browser window is now closed when either the "Save test and exit" or "Exit" buttons are clicked. (@daattali, #202)
