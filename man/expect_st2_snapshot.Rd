\usage{
expect_st2_snapshot(
  app,
  ...,
  name = NULL,
  items = NULL,
  screenshot = NULL,
  cran = FALSE,
  variant = os_name_and_r_version()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{app}{A \link{ShinyDriver2} object.}

\item{...}{Must be empty. Allows for parameter expansion.}

\item{name}{The prefix name to be used for the snapshot. By default, this uses the name supplied to \code{app} on initialization.}

\item{items}{Elements to only be included in the snapshot. If supplied, can contain \code{inputs}, \code{output}, and \code{export}. Each value of \code{items} can either be \code{TRUE} (for all values) or a character list of names to use.}

\item{screenshot}{A boolean indicating whether to take a screenshot.}

\item{cran}{Should these expectations be verified on CRAN? By default,
they are not, because snapshot tests tend to be fragile because they
often rely on minor details of dependencies.}

\item{variant}{A character vector of the form \verb{[os_name]-[r_version]} indicating the operating system and R version (\code{major.minor}) being tested.}
}
