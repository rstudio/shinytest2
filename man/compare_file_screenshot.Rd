\description{
\pkg{chromote} produces screenshot images with inconsistent rounding for areas like
the corner of a text area. This function compares two images and allows for a \code{tolerance}
of so many units in each RGBA color channel.
}
\details{
It is suggested to use this method with \code{\link{AppDriver}}\verb{$expect_screenshot()} to compare
screenshots given a particular tolerance.
